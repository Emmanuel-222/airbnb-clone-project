OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
The goal of this project is to give you practical experience in developing a simple booking and management system using AirBnB as a case study. A good booking system should have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

Project Goals üéØ
At the end of this program, you will have developed adequate knowledge and skills to implement any type of system. You will:
Understand the project scope.
Identify key features to be implemented.
Adhere to designated timelines and milestones.
Utilise the necessary tools and technologies.
Fulfil your roles and responsibilities within the project.

Technologies Used üíª
Introduction to the tech stack:
Frontend: React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, Tailwindcss for styling.
Backend: Python, Django, and Mysql (for illustration purposes; the backend is not the primary focus).
Other Tools: Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration, Jest for testing.

UI/UX Design Planning
Design Goal:
Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
Design the layout and visual elements of the application.
Ensure a consistent brand identity across the application.
Collaborate with frontend developers to implement designs.
Conduct usability testing to gather feedback and improve designs.

Features Overview üõ†Ô∏è
Key features to be implemented:
Property Listings: Display properties with relevant details and images.
Booking System: Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
Search Functionality: Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.

Page 1(Property listing view):
Description: 
  This is the main interface of the Airbnb clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.

Page 2(Listing Detailed View):
Description:
  This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the Airbnb clone. It highlights key features such as the property‚Äôs name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasises clarity and ease of use for potential renters.

Page 3(Simple Checkout View):
Description: 
  This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the Airbnb clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalising the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience.

The importance of a user-friendly design in this project:
A user-friendly design in a booking system makes the process simple, fast, and smooth, helping users complete their bookings easily. It builds trust, reduces errors, improves accessibility, and leads to higher customer satisfaction and more successful bookings.

The importance of identifying design properties of a mock-up design.
Identifying design properties like colours, fonts, and spacing in a mockup is important because it ensures consistency, speeds up development, and helps maintain the original design vision. It also reduces guesswork, improves collaboration between designers and developers, and results in a more polished final product.
